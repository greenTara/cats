## Version 0.1.2

> 2015 July 17

(Due to problems with publishing 0.1.0 and 0.1.1 are incomplete.)

Version 0.1.2 is the first non-snapshot version of the Cats library!
It is intended to assist the creation of dependent libraries and to be
an early look at Cats' design.

Much of the library is quite mature, but there are no source- or
binary-compatibility guarantees at this time. The overarching design
of the library is still somewhat in flux, although mostly we expect
there will be new type classes, instances, and syntax. Some package
and module boundaries may also shift.

For complete credits, see [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md) for a list of
people whose work has made this release possible.
